## Configuration

Before you can run the script, you need to obtain a few credentials:

### 1. Telegram API Credentials

1.  Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and log in with your Telegram account.
2.  Click on **API development tools** and fill in the required details.
3.  You will be given an **API ID** and **API Hash**. Keep these safe.

### 2. OpenRouter API Key

1.  Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and sign up for an account.
2.  Navigate to your account settings and generate a new API key.

## Usage

1.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```
2.  The script will guide you through the setup process. You will be asked to enter the following information:
    *   Your Telegram **API ID**, **API Hash**, and **Phone Number**.
    *   Your **OpenRouter API Key**.
    *   The **username** of the Telegram channel where you want to post.
    *   The **start and end dates** for the posting schedule.

3.  The script will then generate the posts and show you a sample for review.
4.  If you approve the posts, the script will begin scheduling them to your Telegram channel.

## Customization

You can customize the AI's persona by modifying the `DEFAULT_CHARACTER_PROMPT` and `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` variables in `script.py`. This allows you to control the tone, style, and content of the generated posts.
